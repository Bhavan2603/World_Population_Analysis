# World_Population_Analysis
This Power BI project offers dynamic insights into global population trends using interactive visualizations and data analysis. Explore demographic patterns, population growth, age wise distribution and regional disparities with ease and it contains a huge amount of data. The project has been analyzed thoroughly using the Power BI tool for better analysis and understanding of the data.

## Objective
The main objective of doing this project of World Population Analysis is to know the population of each country and to determine particularly the population of male and female.

## Process Overview
1. **Extract:** First, we'll open the Power BI Desktop and extract data from different data sources such as Excel files and text files.
2. **Transform:** After extracting the data, we'll preprocess it in the Power Query Editor by rearranging and cleaning the data.
3. **Load:** Once the data preparation is completed, we'll load the prepared data into Power BI Desktop.

## Data Preparation
Here are the steps involved in the preparation of data:
- Extracting data from Excel files like Population 1950-1999, Population 2000-2049, and Population 2050-2100, and a text file called code-country-region.
- Transforming the data by removing unwanted columns, unpivoting columns, splitting columns, renaming columns, and replacing values.
- Creating data models using a technique called Star Schema, consisting of Dimensional Age, Dimensional Region, and Fact Population.

## Data Visualization
We have used various types of visuals for creating an interactive and meaningful dashboard:
- Text visual for headings
- Line chart for plotting population by age group
- Clustered bar chart for top 10 countries with the highest population
- Pie chart for plotting population by age group
- Clustered column chart for plotting population by region
- Map for showing the population of each country
- Slicers for country and years
- Card visual for depicting the sum of population, male population, and female population
- DAX for calculating male and female population

## Conclusion
This project showcases the power of Power BI in analyzing and visualizing complex data sets. By following the process of data extraction, transformation, and loading, we have created a comprehensive dashboard that provides insights into global population trends. With interactive visualizations and data models, users can easily explore population dynamics, distribution, and projections for different countries and demographic groups. This project demonstrates how Power BI can be leveraged to gain valuable insights from large datasets and make informed decisions based on data-driven analysis.
